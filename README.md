This is a flutter app named "Dice Roll". This app has a button to roll a dice and displays random side of a 6-sided dice. 

Project files are in lib directory. 

File 'main.dart' is simply for setting up environment for runApp() method of flutter which is the main method to display anything on the screen.

File 'gradient_container.dart' is for setting a container and background decoration.

File 'dice_roller.dart' has the dice and button for rolling dice. 

Working in this project made me familiar with statelesswidget, statefulwidget, private class, etc. and more on data types. Got familiar with final and const keyword and their differences. I also got to know about styling the screen, text, etc. and using images in project.
